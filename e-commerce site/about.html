            <h1 class="center"> History of our online business...</h1>
            <p> Originating from Malaysia, our team consisting of five people have decided to embark on a daring journey to start up
                an online business.
                We were skeptical at first but decided to take on the challenge and earn income through an online platform by selling
                backpacks. Once we designed this website and found a local warehouse to store our products, 
                our online business was then established by 2018.
            </p>
            </div>

            <div class="small-box">
            <h1 class="center"> Our products are built for purpose, designed minimalistically and made to last. </h1>
            <p> The quality of our products is what that makes us stand out from the others, simple yet durable. This is made possible  
                as our products are crafted with premium materials supplied from renowned suppliers around the world. 
            </p>
            </div>

            <div class="small-box">
            <h1 class="center">Your satisfaction, our priority. </h1>
            <p>
                When an order is placed, it is of utmost importance that we ensure the product is carefully bubble-wrapped and securely packed before being
                dropped off at your chosen delivery service drop point.
